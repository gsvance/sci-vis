Files here were copied 12/1/19 from /scratch/pyoung3/gregsnsph.dir/runsnsph/
I took only the six files with the prefix 'c16r4' that Patrick indicated
These are stripped starting models--I should be able to get T and rho profiles
Profiles can be compared to the stripped 16 Msol model that went into cco2
Doing this is important for responding to point 2) of the 1st referee report
This is the referee report for the Cas A paper

The file c16r4-inputmodel.dat has five columns all in SNSPH code units
Columns are radius, density, internal energy u, pressure, and velocity

The inputh models have the smoothing lengths, not physical parameters
For this reason, I should not use any of them for the Cas A response

The internal energy u has units of [energy] / [mass]
