Notes from Skype Meeting with Brandon Wiggins, 8/3/17
=====================================================

Brandon is a professor up at Southern Utah University (SUU).

The density info is read in by den_rotate.py, but is not actually used.
Density is figured out by speading out the mass over volume when plotted.
It doesn't even use the smoothing length, just estimates it in a way that looks pretty.
Brandon might send me a better documentation/tutorial for py-sphviewer later on.

As for making isosurfaces and doing 3D ray-tracing...
For 3D light rendering, Brandon uses a Python application called mayavi.
For isosurfaces, he maps the particle data to a fine grid and then plots it.
This is kind of scandalous since the mapping is actually non-unique.
However, that doesn't matter for isosurfaces, so just don't tell people that step.
Brandon has a hack job script for grid mapping that he will send to me.
An industry standard for grid code visualizations is YT. Can use that one.
Brandon will send the mayavi file for my data file so I can play with it.

He has yet to make a script to plot Fe/Ti, but will send it to me later.
