The jet3b and 50Am sims have a bunch of particles with 12C/13C < 20
Jack Schulte and Maitrayee Bose are interested in these particles
They are related to 13C and 15N enrichments in the explosion interiors
I was asked to extract temperature histories for these particles
Might also be useful if I grab densities for them while I'm at it
