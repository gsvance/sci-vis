The jet3b sim has a final tpos of ~26,000 hrs
The 50Am sim has a final tpos of ~43 hrs
Jack Schulte and Maitrayee Bose sent emails in October 2019
They would like to have both of these at the same point in time
I need to extract the xyz etc data from jet3b at ~43 hrs
Which timestep file from jet3b is the closest one to that?
Then I can extract all the physics data from that file
Finally, save that data to an ascii file I can send it to Jack
